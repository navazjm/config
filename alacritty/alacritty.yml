# set by alacritty itself.

env:
  TERM: xterm-256color

window:
  # Window dimensions (changes require restart)

  #dimensions:
    #columns: 130
    #lines: 40

  # Window position (changes require restart)
  #
  # Specified in number of pixels.
  # If the position is not set, the window manager will handle the placement.
  #position:
  #  x: 0
  #  y: 0

  # Window padding (changes require restart)
  #
  # Blank space added around the window in pixels. This padding is scaled

  # Thin stroke font rendering (macOS only)
  #
  # Thin strokes are suitable for retina displays, but for non-retina you
  # probably want this set to false.
  #
  # macOS >= 10.14.x:
  #
  # If the font quality on non-retina display looks bad then set
  # `use_thin_strokes` to `true` and enable font smoothing by running the
  # following command:
  #   `defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO`
  #
  # This is a global setting and will require a log out or restart to take
  # effect.

  # Bell Command
  #
  # This program is executed whenever the bell is rung.

  triple_click: { threshold: 300 }

  # If this is `true`, the cursor is temporarily hidden when typing.
  hide_when_typing: true

# Mouse bindings
#
# Mouse bindings are specified as a list of objects, much like the key
# bindings further below.
#
# To trigger mouse bindings when an application running within Alacritty
# captures the mouse, the `Shift` modifier is automatically added as a
# requirement.
#
# Each mouse binding will specify a:
#
# - `mouse`:
#
#   - Middle
#   - Left
#   - Right
#   - Numeric identifier such as `5`
#
# - `action` (see key bindings for actions not exclusive to mouse mode)
#
# - Mouse exclusive actions:
#
#   - ExpandSelection
#       Expand the selection to the current mouse cursor location.
#
# And optionally:
#
# - `mods` (see key bindings)
#mouse_bindings:
#  - { mouse: Right,                 action: ExpandSelection }
#  - { mouse: Right,  mods: Control, action: ExpandSelection }
