Complete theme for LeftWM. Epitaph is being developed as a starting point
for Gnu/Linux :penguin: users who are transitioning from a complete Desktop Environment to a minimalist WM, this theme does not
aim to be "simple" or "minimalistic", it aims to be complete and user friendly while keeping
modularity at first.
